### Step 2: Add Project Details

**Project Name**:
```
Sushi RAG App - AI-Powered Food Ordering with Vector Search
```

**Project URL** (GitHub):
```
https://github.com/[your-username]/sushi-rag-app
```

**Time Period**:
```
October 2025 - Present
```

**Project Description**:
```
Modern full-stack food ordering application showcasing enterprise AI architecture:

🎯 Key Technologies:
• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for context-aware AI responses
• Vector Database (ChromaDB) with semantic search (<100ms queries)
• OpenAI GPT-4 + Embeddings (text-embedding-3-small, 1536 dimensions)
• LangChain Agentic Framework with autonomous tool selection
• React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (modern frontend)
• Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (robust backend)
• Docker containerization for reproducible environments

✨ Notable Features:
• AI Chat Assistant with natural language menu search
• 69 comprehensive unit tests (Jest + Vitest)
• Semantic search: "spicy vegetarian options" → relevant matches
• Session storage for seamless repeat orders
• Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
• Automated Docker health checks and startup workflow
• Performance monitoring for OpenAI & PostgreSQL queries

🏆 Achievements:
• Production-ready architecture with CI/CD testing
• Sub-100ms vector similarity search performance
• Professional documentation (10 guides + testing docs)
• Enterprise-level error handling and validation

💼 Technical Skills Demonstrated:
Full-Stack Development • AI/ML Integration • Vector Databases • REST APIs • 
Testing (69 tests) • Docker • Database Design • Modern JavaScript (ES6+) • 
React Hooks • Error Handling • Session Management
```

### Step 3: Upload Architecture Diagram

**Recommended Image**: `docs/images/rag-architecture-dark.svg`

**Why This Image**:
- ✅ Shows technical depth
- ✅ Professional dark theme
- ✅ Vector format (crisp at any size)
- ✅ Demonstrates system architecture understanding

**Upload Steps**:
1. Click "Add media" in the project section
2. Upload: `/Users/sbecker11/workspace-sushi/sushi-rag-app/docs/images/rag-architecture-dark.svg`
3. LinkedIn will display it prominently on your profile

**If SVG Not Supported**:
LinkedIn typically accepts SVG files. If needed, you can export the SVG to PNG using an image editor or online converter.

### Step 4: Add Screenshots (Optional)

You can add additional media showing the application:
1. `docs/images/0-pre-order.png` - Menu browsing
2. `docs/images/1-order-conf.png` - Order confirmation
3. `docs/images/2-ai-assistant.png` - AI chat interface
