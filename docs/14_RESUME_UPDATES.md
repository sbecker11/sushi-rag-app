## Interview-Ready Talking Points

### Question: "Tell me about your experience with RAG"

**Answer:**
"I built an end-to-end RAG system for a food ordering application. The architecture uses LangChain to orchestrate the pipeline: first, user queries get converted to embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding model, then ChromaDB performs semantic similarity search to retrieve the most relevant menu items, and finally that context is injected into a GPT-4 prompt for accurate, grounded responses.

For example, when a user asks 'show me spicy vegetarian options under $12', the system retrieves items tagged as spicy and vegetarian, filters by price, and the LLM synthesizes that into a conversational recommendation. Query latency is under 100ms for the vector search, and the whole pipeline returns responses in under 2 seconds."

### Question: "What's your experience with vector databases?"

**Answer:**
"I've used ChromaDB for production semantic search. The key is understanding how embeddings work - you convert text into high-dimensional vectors that encode semantic meaning, then use cosine similarity to find relevant documents. 

In my implementation, I indexed menu items with their descriptions, ingredients, and metadata. The vector store enables queries like 'healthy options' to match items tagged as salads or grilled items, even though those exact words aren't in the query. I also implemented filtering by metadata like price ranges and dietary restrictions.

I chose ChromaDB because it's lightweight, easy to deploy, and has Python/Node.js clients. For larger scale, I'd consider Pinecone or Weaviate with more advanced features."

### Question: "Explain your agentic AI system"

**Answer:**
"I built an agentic system using LangChain's OpenAI Functions Agent. The agent has access to three tools: semantic_search for finding items by description, get_item_details for specific item info, and filter_by_price for budget constraints.

When a user asks a question like 'suggest something spicy under $15', the agent autonomously decides to first call semantic_search with 'spicy', then filter_by_price with 15, and synthesizes the results into a recommendation. The agent logs show which tools it's calling and why, which is great for debugging.

The key advantage is the LLM's reasoning capability - it understands complex, multi-part queries and breaks them down into tool calls without explicit programming for every scenario."

### Question: "How do you handle prompt engineering?"

**Answer:**
"I use structured prompt templates with LangChain's ChatPromptTemplate. For RAG, I have a system prompt that defines the assistant's personality and capabilities, a context section that injects retrieved documents, and the user's question.

I've learned a few key techniques: be explicit about what information is available, instruct the LLM to cite sources when making claims, and keep prompts concise. For example, my system prompt tells the assistant 'Only recommend items from the provided menu context' to prevent hallucinations.

I also use few-shot examples in the prompt for complex formatting requirements, and I version control all prompts in the codebase for reproducibility."
