### Step 1: Navigate to Projects
1. Go to your LinkedIn profile
2. Click "Add profile section"
3. Select "Recommended" â†’ "Add projects" (or find "Projects" in your existing sections)

### Step 2: Add Project Details

**Project Name**:
```
Sushi RAG App - AI-Powered Food Ordering with Vector Search
```

**Project URL** (GitHub):
```
https://github.com/[your-username]/sushi-rag-app
```

```

### Step 3: Upload Architecture Diagram

**Recommended Image**: `docs/images/rag-architecture-dark.png`

**Why This Image**:
- âœ… Shows technical depth
- âœ… Professional rendering with readable text
- âœ… PNG format (compatible everywhere)
- âœ… Demonstrates system architecture understanding

**Upload Steps**:
1. Click "Add media" in the project section
2. Upload: `/Users/sbecker11/workspace-sushi/sushi-rag-app/docs/images/rag-architecture-dark.png`
3. LinkedIn will display it prominently on your profile

**Note**: LinkedIn accepts PNG files, so this should work without any conversion needed.

### Step 4: Add Screenshots (Optional)

You can add additional media showing the application:
1. `docs/images/0-pre-order.png` - Menu browsing
2. `docs/images/1-order-conf.png` - Order confirmation
3. `docs/images/2-ai-assistant.png` - AI chat interface
