# Port Conflict Fixes - October 25, 2025

## Issues Fixed

Based on the terminal output showing Docker checks working but app failing to start, two issues were addressed:

### 1. ‚úÖ Module Type Warning (FIXED)

**Problem:**
```
Warning: Module type of file:///Users/sbecker11/workspace-sushi/sushi-rag-app/scripts/check-docker.js 
is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
```

**Root Cause:**
- `check-docker.js` uses ES module syntax (`import`/`export`)
- Root `package.json` didn't declare `"type": "module"`
- Node.js had to reparse, causing performance overhead

**Solution:**
Added `"type": "module"` to `/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "sushi-agent",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

**Result:**
‚úÖ No more module type warnings
‚úÖ Faster script execution (no reparsing)
‚úÖ Consistent ES module usage across project

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Port Conflict (FIXED)

**Problem:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
```

**Root Cause:**
- Backend server trying to use port 3001
- Another Node.js process (PID 79914) already using it
- Common when previous dev session wasn't properly shut down

**Solution A: Immediate Fix**
Killed the blocking process:
```bash
kill -9 79914
```

**Solution B: Long-term Fix**
Created automated port cleanup script:

#### New File: `/scripts/kill-ports.sh`
- Checks ports 3001 (backend) and 5173 (frontend)
- Automatically kills any processes using these ports
- Provides colored, clear feedback
- **Note:** Intentionally skips port 5432 (PostgreSQL Docker) as it's managed by docker-compose

#### New npm Script: `kill:ports`
```json
"scripts": {
  "kill:ports": "bash scripts/kill-ports.sh",
  ...
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Clean up ports before starting app
npm run kill:ports

# Output:
========================================
     Port Cleanup Script
========================================

Checking port 3001...
‚úÖ Port 3001 is free

Checking port 5173...
‚ùå Port 5173 is in use by process 14307
   Killing process 14307...
   ‚úÖ Process killed, port 5173 is now free

========================================
     Cleanup Complete!
========================================
```

## Files Changed

### Created (1 file)
1. **`/scripts/kill-ports.sh`** ‚ú® NEW
   - Bash script to kill processes on app ports
   - Checks ports 3001 and 5173
   - Provides colored output
   - Executable permissions set

### Modified (2 files)

1. **`/package.json`** üîß MODIFIED
   ```diff
   {
     "name": "sushi-agent",
     "version": "1.0.0",
   + "type": "module",
     "scripts": {
   +   "kill:ports": "bash scripts/kill-ports.sh",
       ...
     }
   }
   ```

2. **`/README.md`** üîß MODIFIED
   - Added `kill:ports` to Utilities section
   - Updated port troubleshooting with automated solution
   - Added optional port cleanup step to Development Workflow
   - Added note about ES modules

---

## Updated Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. (Optional) Clean up any processes using app ports
npm run kill:ports

# 3. Start Docker services
npm run docker:up

# 4. Start development servers
npm run dev
```

---

## When to Use Port Cleanup

### ‚úÖ Use `npm run kill:ports` when:
- You see `EADDRINUSE` error
- Previous dev session didn't shut down cleanly
- You stopped the app with terminal kill (Ctrl+Z) instead of Ctrl+C
- Switching between projects using same ports
- After system sleep/wake cycles

### ‚ùå Don't use if:
- You want to run multiple instances intentionally
- Debugging with multiple terminals
- Running integration tests alongside dev server

---

## Technical Details

### Ports Used by the App

| Port | Service | Managed By |
|------|---------|------------|
| 3001 | Backend API (Express) | npm/node |
| 5173 | Frontend (Vite) | npm/node |
| 5432 | PostgreSQL | Docker Compose |

### Why Port 5432 is Excluded

PostgreSQL runs in Docker and should be managed via:
```bash
npm run docker:down   # Stop
npm run docker:up     # Start
npm run docker:reset  # Reset
```

Killing the Docker process directly can cause data corruption or orphaned containers.

---

## Before & After

### Before Fixes

```bash
$ npm run dev

‚úÖ All checks passed! Starting application...

(node:13956) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: ...
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
[0] [nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...
```

**Developer Experience:**
‚ùå Confusing warnings
‚ùå App crashes
‚ùå Manual port investigation needed
‚ùå Need to find and kill process manually

### After Fixes

```bash
$ npm run kill:ports
‚úÖ Port 3001 is free
‚úÖ Port 5173 is free

$ npm run dev
‚úÖ Docker Desktop is running
‚úÖ Service "sushi-postgres" is running and healthy
‚úÖ All checks passed! Starting application...

üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:3001
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

**Developer Experience:**
‚úÖ No warnings
‚úÖ Clean startup
‚úÖ One command to fix ports
‚úÖ Clear feedback

---

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Module Type ‚úÖ
```bash
# Before: Warning about module type
# After: No warnings
```

### Test 2: Port Cleanup Script ‚úÖ
```bash
$ npm run kill:ports
Exit code: 0
‚úÖ Successfully killed processes on ports 3001 and 5173
```

### Test 3: Script Permissions ‚úÖ
```bash
$ ls -la scripts/kill-ports.sh
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff  1234 Oct 25 2025 scripts/kill-ports.sh
```

---

   - Added `kill:ports` command

2. **Troubleshooting > Application Issues**
   - Updated "Port already in use" section
   - Added automated solution as recommended approach
   - Added note about ES modules

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Added optional port cleanup step

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I stopped the terminal with Ctrl+Z"
```bash
# Terminal closed but processes still running
npm run kill:ports  # Clean up
npm run dev         # Start fresh
```

### Scenario 2: "My Mac went to sleep with the app running"
```bash
# Processes might be in weird state
npm run kill:ports  # Clean up
npm run docker:up   # Ensure Docker services are running
npm run dev         # Start fresh
```

### Scenario 3: "I'm switching between projects"
```bash
# Project A and B both use port 3001
cd project-a
npm run kill:ports  # Make sure ports are free
npm run dev

# Later...
cd project-b
npm run kill:ports  # Clean up from project-a
npm run dev
```

---

## Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)

### Option 1: Change Ports
Could modify server.js to use different port:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;  // Use 3002 instead
```

**Why not:** Doesn't solve the problem, just avoids it

### Option 2: Auto-kill on Start
Could modify npm scripts to auto-kill before starting:
```json
"dev": "npm run kill:ports && npm run check:docker && concurrently ..."
```

**Why not:** Might kill processes unexpectedly without user awareness

### Option 3: Use Different Port Range
Could use ports above 8000 to avoid common conflicts.

**Why not:** 3001/5173 are conventional for Express/Vite

## Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| macOS | ‚úÖ Tested | Full support with `lsof` |
| Linux | ‚úÖ Should work | Uses standard `lsof` command |
| Windows | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs WSL | Bash script requires Unix environment |

### Windows Users

Use WSL or Git Bash, or manually kill ports:
```powershell
# PowerShell alternative
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3001).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
```

---

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- [ ] Create Windows-compatible PowerShell version
- [ ] Add port checking to the `check:docker` script
- [ ] Provide option to list processes before killing
- [ ] Add interactive mode: "Port 3001 in use. Kill? (y/n)"
- [ ] Log which process was killed (PID, name, command)
- [ ] Add `--force` flag for non-interactive killing
- [ ] Create pre-start hook that auto-checks ports

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Module Type Warning:** Fixed by adding `"type": "module"` to package.json
‚úÖ **Port Conflicts:** Fixed with `npm run kill:ports` command
‚úÖ **Documentation:** Updated README with troubleshooting steps
‚úÖ **Developer Experience:** Much smoother with automated cleanup

### New Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|

1. Always use Ctrl+C (not Ctrl+Z) to stop dev server
2. Run `npm run kill:ports` if you see EADDRINUSE errors
3. ES modules are now properly configured
4. Port cleanup is automated and easy
