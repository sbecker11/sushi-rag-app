# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical implementation notes, changelogs, and one-time setup guides that were used during the development of the Sushi RAG App.

## Archived Documents

### Implementation & Setup Guides

- **FUTURE_AI_STACK_ENHANCEMENTS.md** - Technical architecture guide for AI/RAG implementation (useful for future enhancements)
- **IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Step-by-step checklist used during initial AI stack implementation
- **DOCKER_CHECK_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Technical notes on Docker health check implementation
- **RAG_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md** - Summary announcement of completed RAG features

### Changelogs & Fixes

## Why Archived?

These documents served their purpose during development but are no longer needed for:
- **Users**: Current setup instructions in main docs are up-to-date
- **Developers**: Implementation is complete; these were temporary guides
- **Maintainers**: Changes are integrated; no need for separate changelogs

## Current Documentation

For current, user-facing documentation, see the main [docs/](../) folder:
- **00_SETUP.md** - Complete setup, configuration, environment, and OpenAI guide
- **01_DOCKER_WORKFLOW.md** - Docker workflow and automation
- **02_TESTING.md** - Complete testing guide with statistics and examples
