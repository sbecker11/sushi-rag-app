# Automated Startup - Single Command to Rule Them All

## Overview

`npm run dev` now automatically handles the entire startup sequence - no more manual steps!

## What Changed

### Before (Manual Steps)
```bash
# Step 1: Clean up ports
npm run kill:ports

# Step 2: Start Docker
npm run docker:up

# Step 3: Check everything
npm run check:docker

# Step 4: Start the app
npm run dev
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Multiple commands to remember
- ❌ Easy to forget a step
- ❌ Annoying to type every time
- ❌ Not beginner-friendly

### After (One Command)
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single command does everything
- ✅ Automatic port cleanup
- ✅ Automatic Docker startup
- ✅ Automatic health checks
- ✅ Beginner-friendly

## How It Works

### New Scripts: `prestart` and `check:docker-daemon`

Created new npm scripts that run all setup tasks:

```json
"check:docker-daemon": "bash scripts/check-docker-daemon.sh",
"cleanup:docker": "bash scripts/cleanup-docker-containers.sh",
"prestart": "npm run kill:ports && npm run check:docker-daemon && npm run cleanup:docker && npm run docker:up && npm run check:docker"
```

This script:
1. 🧹 **Kills old processes** on ports 3001 and 5173
2. 🔍 **Checks Docker Desktop is running** (fails fast with clear message if not)
3. 🗑️ **Removes old Docker containers** (prevents name conflicts)
4. 🐳 **Starts Docker services** (PostgreSQL)
5. ✅ **Checks health** of Docker services

### Updated Scripts

All development commands now use `prestart`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prestart": "npm run kill:ports && npm run docker:up && npm run check:docker",
    "dev": "npm run prestart && concurrently \"cd backend && npm run dev\" \"cd frontend && npm run dev\"",
    "server": "npm run prestart && cd backend && npm run dev",
    "client": "npm run prestart && cd frontend && npm run dev"
  }
}
```

## What Happens When You Run `npm run dev`

### Step 1: Port Cleanup (🧹 kill:ports)
```
========================================
     Port Cleanup Script
========================================

Checking port 3001...
✅ Port 3001 is free

Checking port 5173...
❌ Port 5173 is in use by process 14307
   Killing process 14307...
   ✅ Process killed, port 5173 is now free

========================================
     Cleanup Complete!
========================================
```

### Step 2: Docker Daemon Check (🔍 check:docker-daemon)
```
🔍 Checking if Docker Desktop is running...
✅ Docker Desktop is running
```

**If Docker Desktop is NOT running, you'll see:**
```
🔍 Checking if Docker Desktop is running...
❌ Docker Desktop is NOT running!

Please start Docker Desktop and try again.
You can start it by:
  - Opening Docker Desktop from Applications
  - Or running: open -a Docker
```

**The script stops here** - it won't try to start containers if Docker isn't running, preventing cryptic error messages.

### Step 3: Docker Container Cleanup (🗑️ cleanup:docker)
```
🧹 Cleaning up old Docker containers...
   Found old sushi-postgres container
   Stopping container...
   Removing container...
   ✅ Old container removed
```

**Or if no cleanup needed:**
```
🧹 Cleaning up old Docker containers...
   ✅ No cleanup needed
```

This prevents the common error: `The container name "/sushi-postgres" is already in use`

### Step 4: Docker Startup (🐳 docker:up)
```
[+] Running 2/2
 ✔ Network sushi-rag-app_default       Created
 ✔ Container sushi-postgres            Started
```

### Step 5: Health Check (✅ check:docker)
```
========================================
     Docker & Services Check
========================================

🔍 Checking if Docker Desktop is running...
✅ Docker Desktop is running

🔍 Checking required services...
✅ Service "sushi-postgres" is running and healthy

✅ All checks passed! Starting application...
========================================
```

### Step 6: Start Application (🚀 dev)
```
[0] 🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3001
[1] ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

## Usage

### Start Everything
```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! One command, everything works.

### Start Backend Only
```bash
npm run server
```
(Also runs prestart checks)

### Start Frontend Only
```bash
npm run client
```
(Also runs prestart checks)

### Run Checks Manually
```bash
npm run prestart
```

## Commands Breakdown

| Command | What It Does | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Prestart + both servers | **Primary development command** |
| `npm run server` | Prestart + backend only | Testing backend API only |
| `npm run client` | Prestart + frontend only | Frontend development |
| `npm run prestart` | All checks/setup | Manual verification |
| `npm run check:docker-daemon` | Check if Docker running | Quick Docker status |
| `npm run cleanup:docker` | Remove old containers | When you get "container name in use" |
| `npm run kill:ports` | Port cleanup | When you get EADDRINUSE |
| `npm run docker:up` | Start Docker services | Manual Docker management |
| `npm run check:docker` | Full health check | Verify services status |

## Error Handling

Each step can fail independently with clear messages:

### If Docker Desktop Not Running
```
❌ Docker Desktop is NOT running!

Please start Docker Desktop and try again.
You can start it by:
  - Opening Docker Desktop from Applications
  - Or running: open -a Docker
```

**Solution:** Start Docker Desktop, then run `npm run dev` again

### If Port Still Busy
```
❌ Port 3001 is in use by process 12345
   Killing process 12345...
   ❌ Failed to kill process on port 3001
```

**Solution:** Manually kill the process:
```bash
kill -9 12345
npm run dev
```

### If Services Not Starting
```
Error: Cannot start container sushi-postgres: port 5432 already allocated
```

**Solution:** 
```bash
npm run docker:down
npm run dev
```

## Comparison: Old vs New Workflow

### Old Workflow (4-5 commands)
```bash
# Check if ports are free
lsof -i :3001
lsof -i :5173

# Kill processes if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Start Docker
npm run docker:up

# Wait for it to be ready...

# Check if it's healthy
docker ps

# Finally start the app
npm run dev
```

**Time:** ~2-3 minutes  
**Steps:** 5-7 commands  
**Errors:** Common (forgot a step, Docker not ready, port conflicts)

### New Workflow (1 command)
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Time:** ~30 seconds (automated)  
**Steps:** 1 command  
**Errors:** Rare (everything is checked automatically)

## When Each Script Runs Prestart

| Command | Runs Prestart? | Why |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| `npm run dev` | ✅ Yes | Full app needs everything ready |
| `npm run server` | ✅ Yes | Backend needs database |
| `npm run client` | ✅ Yes | Frontend needs backend API |
| `npm run db:setup` | ⚠️ Partial | Just Docker check (no port kill) |
| `npm run docker:up` | ❌ No | It IS part of prestart |
| `npm run docker:down` | ❌ No | Shutdown command |

## Advanced Usage

### Skip Prestart Checks

If you need to bypass the automatic checks:

```bash
# Start backend without checks
cd backend && npm run dev

# Start frontend without checks
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Run Prestart Without Starting App

```bash
# Just do the setup/checks
npm run prestart
```

Useful for:
- Verifying environment before coding
- Setting up for manual testing
- Debugging startup issues

### Custom Startup Order

If you want to run parts separately:

```bash
# 1. Clean ports only
npm run kill:ports

# 2. Start Docker only
npm run docker:up

# 3. Check health only
npm run check:docker

# 4. Start backend only (no checks)
cd backend && npm run dev
```

## Performance

### Overhead

| Step | Time | Skippable? |
|------|------|-----------|
| Port cleanup | ~0.5s | If no conflicts |
| Docker start | ~5-10s | If already running |
| Health check | ~1s | No |
| **Total** | **~6-11s** | **Partially** |

### Optimization

Docker Compose is smart:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
[+] Running 1/1
 ✔ Container sushi-postgres  Running    0.0s
```

If containers are already running, it skips startup (instant).

## Troubleshooting

### "I see prestart running multiple times"

This is normal when running `npm run dev`:
- Runs once for `dev`
- (Doesn't run again for `server` and `client` because they're in the concurrently string)

If you see it multiple times, you might have old scripts cached. Run:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm run dev
```

### "Docker containers keep restarting"

Check Docker logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs
```

Common causes:
- Port 5432 conflict (another PostgreSQL running)
- Insufficient memory (Docker Desktop settings)
- Corrupted volumes

**Solution:**
```bash
npm run docker:reset  # Nuclear option: removes data
```

### "I want the old behavior back"

Edit `package.json`:
```json
"dev": "npm run check:docker && concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
```

Remove `prestart` calls and run setup manually.

## Best Practices

### Daily Development

```bash
# Morning: Start coding
npm run dev

# Evening: Stop everything
# Ctrl+C (stops servers)
npm run docker:down  # Optional: stop Docker
```

### After System Sleep/Restart

```bash
# Just run dev - it handles everything
npm run dev
```

### Working on Multiple Projects

```bash
# Switch from project A to B
cd project-a
# Ctrl+C
npm run docker:down

cd ../project-b
npm run dev  # Automatically cleans ports and starts fresh
```

### CI/CD Integration

In CI environments, you might want to skip some checks:

```json
"dev:ci": "concurrently \"cd backend && npm run dev\" \"cd frontend && npm run dev\""
```
