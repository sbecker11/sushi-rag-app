# ü§ñ OpenAI API Key Setup Guide

## Do I Need an OpenAI API Key?

**No, it's optional!** The app works perfectly fine without it:
- ‚úÖ Without key: Uses a static menu with 8 delicious pre-configured sushi items
- ‚ú® With key: Menu items are dynamically generated by GPT-4

## How to Get an OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account

1. Go to **https://platform.openai.com/**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (or **"Log In"** if you have an account)
3. Complete the registration process

### Step 2: Add Payment Method

**Important**: OpenAI requires a payment method, but you only pay for what you use.

1. Go to **https://platform.openai.com/account/billing**
2. Click **"Add payment method"**
3. Enter your credit/debit card information
4. **Optional**: Set usage limits to control costs:
   - Go to **Billing ‚Üí Usage limits**
   - Set a monthly budget (e.g., $5 or $10)

### Step 3: Create API Key

1. Navigate to **https://platform.openai.com/api-keys**
2. Click **"Create new secret key"**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Sushi Order App")
4. Click **"Create secret key"**
5. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the key immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
   - It looks like: `sk-proj-...` or `sk-...`

### Step 4: Add Key to Your App

Open your `.env` file and replace the placeholder:

```bash
# Before
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# After (use your actual key)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Or run this command (replace with your actual key):

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
sed -i '' 's/OPENAI_API_KEY=.*/OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-key-here/' .env
```

### Step 5: Restart the Backend

If the app is already running, restart the backend to load the new API key:

```bash
# Stop the app (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

## üí∞ Pricing

OpenAI pricing is very affordable for this app:

- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per menu generation
- **GPT-3.5-Turbo**: ~$0.002 per menu generation (if you modify the code)
- Menu is cached on the backend, so it's only generated once until you restart

**Estimated cost**: If you restart the app 100 times, it would cost ~$3 with GPT-4.

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit your API key to git** (already in `.gitignore`)
2. **Don't share your `.env` file**
3. **Set usage limits** in your OpenAI dashboard
4. **Rotate keys periodically** for security
5. **Delete unused keys** from the OpenAI dashboard

## üß™ Testing Your API Key

Once you've added the key, you can test it:

```bash
# Check if the backend can connect
curl http://localhost:3001/api/menu
```

Look for the console message:
- ‚úÖ `Generated menu from OpenAI LLM` - API key working!
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è `Using static menu` - Using fallback (no key or error)

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error

- Make sure you copied the entire key (starts with `sk-`)
- Check for extra spaces before/after the key in `.env`
- Verify the key is active in your OpenAI dashboard

### "Insufficient Quota" Error

- Add a payment method to your OpenAI account
- Check your billing limits aren't set too low

### "Rate Limit" Error

- You're making too many requests
- The app caches menus, so this shouldn't happen often
- Wait a minute and try again

## üåü Alternative: Use Without OpenAI

If you prefer not to use OpenAI, the app works great with the static menu:

1. Keep `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here` in `.env`
2. The app will automatically use the static menu
3. You'll have 8 delicious sushi items to order from!
